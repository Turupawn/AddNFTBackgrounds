```

## Usage 📝

1. Place NFT images without background in `./images/`
2. Place NFT metadata corresponding to images in `./metadata/`
3. Place backgrounds in `./backgrounds/`, make sure the filename corresponds to the `background` metadata trait
4. Edit the rarities in the `backgrounds_amount` array in `add_backgrounds.js`
5. Run `node add_backgrounds.js`

The images and metadata should be exported now to `./output/`.
